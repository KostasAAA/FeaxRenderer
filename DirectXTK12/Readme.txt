February 7, 2019

This package contains the "DirectX Tool Kit", a collection of helper classes for
writing Direct3D 12 C++ code for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, Win32
desktop applications for Windows 10, and Xbox One.

This code is designed to build with Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 or Visual Studio 2017.
It is recommended that you make use of VS 2015 Update 3, Windows Tools 1.4.1, and the
Windows 10 Anniversary Update SDK (14393) -or- VS 2017 (15.9 update) with the
Windows 10 October 2018 Update SDK (17763).

--------
XBOX ONE
--------

* Developers using the Xbox One XDK need to generate the
  Src\Shaders\Compiled\XboxOne*.inc files to build the library as they are not
  included in the distribution package. They are built by running the script
  in Src\Shaders - "CompileShaders xbox" from the "Xbox One XDK Command Prompt".
  They are XDK version-specific. While they will continue to work if outdated,
  a mismatch will cause runtime compilation overhead that would otherwise be
  avoided.


---------------------------------
COMPARISONS TO DIRECTX 11 VERSION
---------------------------------

* No support for loading .CMO models or DGSL effect shaders (i.e. DGSLEffect)

* VertexTypes does not include VertexPositionNormalTangentColorTexture or
  VertexPositionNormalTangentColorTextureSkinning which were intended for use
  with the DGSL pipeline.

* DirectX Tool Kit for DirectX 11 supports Feature Level 9.x, while DirectX 12
  requires Direct3D Feature Level 11.0. There are no expected DirectX 12 drivers
  for any lower feature level devices.

* The library assumes it is building for Windows 10 (aka _WIN32_WINNT=0x0A00)
  so it makes use of XAudio 2.9 and WIC2 as well as DirectX 12.

* DirectX Tool Kit for Audio, GamePad, Keyboard, Mouse, and SimpleMath are
  identical to the DirectX 11 version.


-------------
RELEASE NOTES
-------------

* The VS 2017 projects make use of /permissive- for improved C++ standard
  conformance. Use of a Windows 10 SDK prior to the Fall Creators Update (16299)
  or an Xbox One XDK prior to June 2017 QFE 4 may result in failures due to
  problems with the system headers. You can work around these by disabling this
  switch in the project files which is found in the <ConformanceMode> elements.

* The VS 2017 projects require the 15.5 update or later. For UWP and Win32
  classic desktop projects with the 15.5 - 15.7 updates, you need to install the
  standalone Windows 10 SDK (17763) which is otherwise included in the 15.8.6 or
  later update. Older VS 2017 updates will fail to load the projects due to use
  of the <ConformanceMode> element. If using the 15.5 or 15.6 updates, you will
  see "warning D9002: ignoring unknown option '/Zc:__cplusplus'" because this
  switch isn't supported until 15.7. It is safe to ignore this warning, or you
  can edit the project files <AdditionalOptions> elements.

* The UWP projects include configurations for the ARM64 platform. These require
  VS 2017 (15.9 update) to build.
